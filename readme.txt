BusinessPress lets you control the WordPress core updates and plugin installing/editing/upgrading to prevent issues with your business websites.

== Description ==

WordPress has a major release twice year, each time with a risk of breaking the way your website works. This plugin removes all the messages to update (button from dashboard, the admin footer link and admin notice).

WordPress also automatically updates your website to the latest minor release. We like that, but these updates can cause issues as well. That's why BusinessPress delays the updates for 5 days.

This plugin also allows you to stop your client from installing new plugins (to break the website) while allowing them to take care of the plugin updates.

###You can disable the following capabilities

* Activate and deactivate plugins and themes
* Update plugins and themes
* Install, Edit and delete plugns and themes

###Coming soon

* Checkboxes to disable all the new WordPress features one by one. A lot of them are not needed and only make the site more fragile or slower.
* Protecting your site privacy from WordPress.org API services

== Installation ==

Once the plugin is installed, you will be prompted to configure it, otherwise it won't do anything.

Simply click the notice or go to Settings -> BusinessPress. There you will be allowed to lock down the admin privileges to your own email address or your email domain (in case you want to keep admin access for your entire company).

From that point forward, you will have to elevated admin privileges over the website.
